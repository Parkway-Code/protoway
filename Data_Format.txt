In order for data to be parsed, a format must be achieved at some point in the pipeline. This could happen as early as
the sensor management boards, or the cloud resources, but preferably before the app itself. 

The format proposed is as follows, in almost-json

{
garage

//if spot-garage
spot: 
{
Floor
id
status
}

//if percent fill garage
Pfill

//if floor occupancy garage
floor:
{
size
fill
}

//if total occupancy
size
fill

open/closedgarage
}
